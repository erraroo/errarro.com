Today we are excited to announce the Alpha of erraroo! Erraroo makes it
painless to capture errors in your Ember applications.

## Open Source

All the source behind erraroo is completely [open source](http://github.com/erraroo).

## More features, frameworks planned for the future

Right now our main focus is Ember.js.  We simplely love the project and
want to make a tool that really helps developers find and fix bugs
quickly.
